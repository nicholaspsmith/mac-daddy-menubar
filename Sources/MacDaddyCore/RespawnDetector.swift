// MARK: - Respawn-loop detector

// Records per-comm PIDs at each poll, then flags names that look like a
// crash loop rather than a worker pool. Two patterns we need to tell apart:
//
//   crash loop:  peak simultaneous ≈ 1, but many distinct PIDs over time
//                (one slot keeps getting replaced — what contactsd did
//                during the May 19 incident).
//
//   worker pool: peak simultaneous = N, many distinct PIDs over time
//                (mdworker_shared, plugin-container, ExtensionKit
//                helpers — all designed to be short-lived).
//
// The discriminator is `distinct / peak`: how many times each slot was
// replaced inside the window. Flag only when that ratio is high enough
// that normal short-lived helpers don't trip it.
//
// Also excluded: `ps` (we spawn it every poll, so it'd always self-flag)
// and `<defunct>` (a state, not an identity — every reaped zombie ends
// up there regardless of original name).
